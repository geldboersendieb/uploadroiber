# uploadroiber
android-app that lets you upload files via sftp from your mobile phone in a few taps and pastes the link in your clipboard so you can paste it in a chat or something

i am using IRC a lot on my mobile phone and if you want to share photos with someone there you have to use cancerous services like imgur.
you'll need several thousands of taps till you got the link ready to be pasted in termux or whatever you use.

with this app it'll take only a few.
